### 🧠 **PySpark Practice Question — Joins & Aggregations**

You are given two DataFrames:

* **`orders`**

  | order_id | customer_id | amount | order_date |
  | -------- | ----------- | ------ | ---------- |
  | 1        | 101         | 250    | 2025-10-01 |
  | 2        | 102         | 300    | 2025-10-01 |
  | 3        | 101         | 450    | 2025-10-02 |
  | 4        | 103         | 200    | 2025-10-03 |

* **`customers`**

  | customer_id | name      | city      |
  | ----------- | --------- | --------- |
  | 101         | John Doe  | Mumbai    |
  | 102         | Alice Roy | Delhi     |
  | 103         | Bob Smith | Bangalore |

### 🧰 **Task**

Using PySpark:

1. Join the two DataFrames on `customer_id`.
2. Calculate the **total order amount per customer**.
3. Sort the result in **descending order of total amount**.
4. Display the top 2 customers.

---

### 💡 *Hints*

* Use `join()` to combine DataFrames.
* Use `groupBy()` and `agg(sum())` for aggregation.
* Use `orderBy()` with `desc()` for sorting.
* Use `limit()` to get the top 2.

Would you like me to give **increasing difficulty** (e.g., intermediate or advanced transformations like window functions or UDFs) for tomorrow’s question?
