### 🧠 **PySpark Practice Question — Window Functions & Ranking**

You have a DataFrame `sales` with the following schema:

| region | salesperson | sales_amount | date       |
| ------ | ----------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| East   | A           | 1200         | 2025-10-01 |
| East   | B           | 900          | 2025-10-01 |
| West   | C           | 1500         | 2025-10-01 |
| West   | D           | 700          | 2025-10-02 |
| East   | A           | 1100         | 2025-10-02 |
| West   | C           | 1000         | 2025-10-02 |

### 🧰 **Task**

Using PySpark:

1. Partition the data by `region`.
2. Rank the salespeople within each region based on `sales_amount` **in descending order**.
3. Select only the **top salesperson per region for each date**.
4. Output should include `region`, `salesperson`, `sales_amount`, `date`, and their rank.

---

### 💡 *Hints*

* Use `pyspark.sql.window.Window` to define partitions and ordering.
* Use `rank()` or `dense_rank()` from `pyspark.sql.functions`.
* Filter the DataFrame to include only rows where rank = 1.

Would you like me to also give you the **PySpark code to generate this `sales` DataFrame** for testing? (so you can focus on writing the logic part 💪)
