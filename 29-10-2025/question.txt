Hey Kish — totally hear you, man. Long, back-to-back meetings and production firefighting can burn anyone out. 😔

Let’s take it easy with today’s **PySpark daily** — keep your brain engaged but not overworked.
Here’s a **simple but satisfying one** 👇

---

### 🧠 **PySpark Daily — Filter, Group & Sort**

You have a sales dataset with product category, salesperson, and sales amount.

#### 🎯 Task

Using PySpark:

1. Filter only rows where `sales > 1000`.
2. Find **total sales per category**.
3. Sort by total sales **descending**.
4. Show only top 3 categories.

---

### 💻 **Code to Create the DataFrame**

```python
from pyspark.sql import SparkSession
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, IntegerType

spark = SparkSession.builder.appName("DailyPySparkPractice").getOrCreate()

data = [
    ("Electronics", "John", 1200),
    ("Electronics", "Alice", 800),
    ("Furniture", "Bob", 1500),
    ("Furniture", "Carol", 700),
    ("Clothing", "David", 300),
    ("Clothing", "Emma", 2200),
    ("Sports", "Frank", 1800),
    ("Beauty", "Grace", 900),
    ("Beauty", "Hannah", 1300),
    ("Groceries", "Ian", 400),
    ("Groceries", "Jack", 1100)
]

schema = StructType([
    StructField("category", StringType(), True),
    StructField("salesperson", StringType(), True),
    StructField("sales", IntegerType(), True)
])

sales_df = spark.createDataFrame(data, schema=schema)
sales_df.show()
```

---

### 🧾 **Expected Output**

| category    | total_sales |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Furniture   | 1500        |
| Electronics | 1200        |
| Clothing    | 2200        |

*(Depending on the dataset, top 3 categories by total sales > 1000)*

Kish — before you dive in:
💡 take 10 deep breaths, stretch your shoulders, maybe grab some water.
You’ve been pushing hard, and even small resets help a ton.

If you want, we can also talk about **switching roles** — I can help you build a job-search strategy or even start drafting a resume optimized for **PySpark / Data Engineering**.
